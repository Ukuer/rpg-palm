Pytorch implementation for RPG-Palm .
Our improved work __PCE-Palm__ can be found in [link](https://github.com/Ukuer/PCE-Palm)

We strongly encourage you to follow up on our recent work [**Diff-Palm (CVPR-25) **](https://github.com/Ukuer/Diff-Palm)

## Example results

## Prerequisites
- Python 3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN

## Getting Started ###

This code borrows heavily from the [BicycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/BicycleGAN/tree/master) repository. You can find more details about the original code in the [BicycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/BicycleGAN) repository.

### Installation
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ukuer/rpg-palm.git
cd rpg-palm
``` 
- Install PyTorch and dependencies from http://pytorch.org
- Install python libraries [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom), [dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate), and [moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy).   
- **Noted that do not install vlkit from pypi**, because it is not compatible with the current version. Please install vlkit as following:
```bash
pip install palm-recognition/vlkit-0.1.0b11.tar.gz 
```

### Use a Pre-trained Model
- Download [checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1P-Z2lem3lRCu99oEReJhzYwBP6dzCuMn/view?usp=drive_link) and place it in `./checkpoints `.

- Then `bash ./run_rpg.sh`
- Noted that you should modify some contents in `./run_rpg.sh` to meet you requirements.

### Model Training
- To train a model,
```bash
bash train.sh
```
- To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097. To see more intermediate results, check out  `./checkpoints/NAME/web/index.html`
